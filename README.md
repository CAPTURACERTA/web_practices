# web_practices
Web development isn't my focus, it just doesn't interest me at all. However, I do recognize that it's a great practice to have, at least, the essential knowledge of some areas. Following that, it's a great idea to be able to expose your ideas, right? Putting them on the web is the best way to achieve that, and so here we are.

This repository serves as a collection of foundational web development exercises (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap) aimed at building the necessary frontend and backend (Flask) skills for project deployment.

### 1. [PRICING PAGE - Bootstrap Practice](https://github.com/CAPTURACERTA/web_practices/blob/main/pricing/index.html)
- **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (Grid System, Utilities, Components)
- **Description:**
'Pricing' was my first solid study with Bootstrap. This project focuses on implementing the framework's **Grid System** and **Card components** to create a responsive layout, minimizing the need for custom CSS.
- **Reference**: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing/

> As I mentioned before, web dev isn't my focus, so using Bootstrap to streamline all of the front-end stuff will probably be a law from now on. It's pretty boring having to set all the best configurations on CSS everytime, Bootstrap, however, is actually pretty fun to use.
